## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Explanation

I have created an endpoint using next.js API routes to support a POST method that receives a body attribute called 'commands,' which, as output, provides the robot's final position and direction after completing its movements.

I havve taken about 2 hours to develop all the code and perform the necessary deployment.
